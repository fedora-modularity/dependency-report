# python2-ecosystem
This is a dependency report for the python2-ecosystem module.

An initial [modulemd file](python2-ecosystem.yaml) has been generated. It is experimental and probably unusable at this point.
## Dependencies
These are modules identified as dependencies.
### Runtime
This list might not be complete. There might be other packages in the *Binary RPM packages (all arches combined)* section that needs to be split to different modules.
* [platform](../platform)
* [python2](../python2)
### Build
This list might not be complete.
Please see the **missing RPM build dependencies ([source](all/buildtime-source-packages-short.txt) or [binary](all/buildtime-binary-packages-short.txt)) lists** for more information.
* [bootstrap](../bootstrap)
## Binary RPM packages
These are RPM dependencies of the [python2-ecosystem top-level package set](python2-ecosystem.csv). They should be either:
* split into other modules and be used as modular dependencies
* included in this python2-ecosystem module
