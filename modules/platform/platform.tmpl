    summary: The base system and common, shared userland
    description: >-
        Platform provides a stable system base that can be either used on
        its own or extended with additional modules built on top of it.
        The module defines the system release by providing the filesystem
        layout, core utilities, libraries and runtimes as well as the
        minimal buildroot for other modules.
